# Contributing

- File an Issue that describes the change, the *user effect*, and the test you ran.
- Update the **Assumption Ledger** if your change leans on a guess or threshold.
- Prefer small, well-commented PRs with before/after artifacts (audio, csv, video).

## Commit style
- Imperative (`Add`, `Fix`, `Tune`) with a one-line rationale when useful.
