# Privacy & Ethics (stub)

- No hidden analytics, online calls, or telemetry.
- Logging is **opt‑in** and visibly indicated.
- All demo apps run offline; recordings require explicit consent.
- Parts and design notes prefer commodity, repairable components.
- Accessibility: clear visual feedback, readable docs, adaptable mappings.

> See the main project README for the broader ethics statement and adapt per site/pilot.
