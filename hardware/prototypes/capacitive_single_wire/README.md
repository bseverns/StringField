# Prototype: Capacitive (Single‑Wire)

- **Parts:** a single insulated wire “string,” high‑impedance input, optional guard.
- **Wiring:** suspend wire in space; connect to high‑Z ADC or cap‑IC; ensure player ground reference.
- **Tuning:** baseline sample over 2–3 seconds; trigger on delta above baseline + debounce.
- **Gotchas:** humidity drift; laptop ground loops; teach safe grounding practices.
