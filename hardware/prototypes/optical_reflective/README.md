# Prototype: Optical (Reflective IR)

- **Parts:** IR LED + phototransistor pair (e.g., TCRT5000), resistor, optional 38 kHz modulation.
- **Wiring:** point the pair at the “string” surface (hand, ribbon, reflective cord). Shield from room light if possible.
- **Tuning:** start with low LED drive; raise until stable; add simple LPF on sensor line.
- **Gotchas:** glossy black absorbs; fluorescent/LED flicker can alias—prefer modulation.
