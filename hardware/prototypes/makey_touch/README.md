# Prototype: MaKey‑style Touch‑to‑Ground

- **Parts:** foil or string tied to a GPIO configured with pull‑up; player holds ground.
- **Wiring:** contact closes to ground; treat as digital or measure resistance.
- **Tuning:** add release guard to avoid chatter; map press length → velocity proxy.
- **Gotchas:** depends on player footwear/surface; emphasize safety & clarity.
